# sifter

Sifter is a recon tool, originally designed to check the status of domains/hosts/ip's

From there a few extra tools were integrated in to further the info gathering process.

So far results are able to be parsed to:

-Nmap

-Nikto

-Dirbuster

-Blackwidow '--> Blackwidow 1N3 - https://github.com/1N3/blackwidow

-WPScan '--> WPScan WPScanTeam - https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan

Any suggestions for extra modules are welcome.
